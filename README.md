# RCHS-Computer-Science-Club-2022
All of the resources and projects for the Raleigh Charter's Computer Science Club 2021-2022! 

# How to download resources
If you would like to download resources, simply click the green button that says "Code" and click "Download ZIP." This download a ZIP file of all of the presentations and other resources on that branch. Remember, we also have a [Google Drive] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1d9IF0oiM-xoBe9AXo0UpJoI5JzJjYbpf?usp=sharing) that you can download the same things if you find Github too hard to use (*but, we will be using GitHub this year!*).

#Branches
It is important to **not commit to main unless you have specific permission from one of the leaders.** Think of the main as the front of an extravagent store; you might think you have an amazing product, but you still have to test it and see if everything works! This is why will have different branches which all of you can push to, and we will create Pull Requests to merge all of these together for your collaborative projects (if you're lost, wait for the Github presentation later in the year). 

#Questions?
As always, we are **just an email away for any questions**. Don't hesitate to email any of us if you have any concerns or feedback about this repository or anything else!
